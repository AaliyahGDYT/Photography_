<h1> Photography and Art </h1>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-section">
<p>Im passionate about Photography and Art because it gives me a chance to create,and express myself in different ways.</p>
<p>I was introduced to it when I started to take pictures of people and take pictures of random things I find interesting.<br>I mainly inspired myself and the people I took pictures of. The people I see on social media that make a living from being a professional photographer.</p>
